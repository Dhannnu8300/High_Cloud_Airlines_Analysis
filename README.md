Built interactive dashboards to monitor passenger preferences, route efficiency, and flight trends, using SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

## Technologies Used:
SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python (Pandas, Numpy)

## Key Contributions:
- Performed route optimization and load factor analysis.
- Identified passenger trends and operational inefficiencies.
- Created business intelligence reports for stakeholder decision-making.
- In this project we analyzed High Cloud Airlines operations, focusing on key metrics like passenger preferences, route efficiency, and flight trends.
- It involves data extraction, cleaning, and visualization using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL. Insights highlight higher passenger traffic on weekdays, variations in flight distances, and disparities in 
  airline load factors.
  
## Recommendations: strategic marketing for weekend travel, optimizing flight allocations for longer distances, and enhancing customer experience. The dashboards provide data-driven insights to improve airline performance and passenger satisfaction.
